#  Exposure_QuickSpin.py shows how to customize image exposure time
#  using the QuickSpin API. QuickSpin is a subset of the Spinnaker library
#  that allows for simpler node access and control.
#
#  This example prepares the camera, sets a new exposure time, and restores
#  the camera to its default state. Ensuring custom values fall within an
#  acceptable range is also touched on. Retrieving and setting information
#  is the only portion of the example that differs from Exposure.
#
#  A much wider range of topics is covered in the full Spinnaker examples than
#  in the QuickSpin ones. There are only enough QuickSpin examples to
#  demonstrate node access and to get started with the API; please see full
#  Spinnaker examples for further or specific knowledge on a topic.
