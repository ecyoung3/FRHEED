# NodeMapInfo_QuickSpin.py shows how to interact with nodes
# using the QuickSpin API. QuickSpin is a subset of the Spinnaker library
# that allows for simpler node access and control.
#
# This example demonstrates the retrieval of information from both the
# transport layer and the camera. Because the focus of this example is node
# access, which is where QuickSpin and regular Spinnaker differ, this
# example differs from NodeMapInfo quite a bit.
#
# A much wider range of topics is covered in the full Spinnaker examples than
# in the QuickSpin ones. There are only enough QuickSpin examples to
# demonstrate node access and to get started with the API; please see full
# Spinnaker examples for further or specific knowledge on a topic.

    Prints device information from the transport layer.

    *** NOTES ***
    In QuickSpin, accessing device information on the transport layer is
    accomplished via a camera's TLDevice property. The TLDevice property
    houses nodes related to general device information such as the three
    demonstrated below, device access status, XML and GUI paths and
    locations, and GEV information to name a few. The TLDevice property
    allows access to nodes that would generally be retrieved through the
    TL device nodemap in full Spinnaker.

    Notice that each node is checked for availability and readability
    prior to value retrieval. Checking for availability and readability
    (or writability when applicable) whenever a node is accessed is
    important in terms of error handling. If a node retrieval error
    occurs but remains unhandled, an exception is thrown.

    Most camera interaction happens through GenICam nodes. The
