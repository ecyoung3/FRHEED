#   Logging.py shows how to create a handler to access logging events.
#   It relies on information provided in the Enumeration, Acquisition, and
#   NodeMapInfo examples.
#
#   It can also be helpful to familiarize yourself with the NodeMapCallback
#   example, as nodemap callbacks follow the same general procedure as
#   events, but with a few less steps.
#
#   This example creates a user-defined class, LoggingEventHandler, that inherits
#   from the Spinnaker class, LoggingEventHandler. The child class allows the user to
#   define any properties, parameters, and the event handler itself while LoggingEventHandler
#   allows the child class to appropriately interface with the Spinnaker SDK.

# information on logging level philosophy.
