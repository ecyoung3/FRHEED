#   ImageEvents.py shows how to acquire images using the image event handler.
#   It relies on information provided in the Enumeration, Acquisition,
#   and NodeMapInfo examples.
#
#   It can also be helpful to familiarize yourself with the NodeMapCallback
#   example, as nodemap callbacks follow the same general procedure as
#   events, but with a few less steps.
#
#   This example creates a user-defined class, ImageEventHandler, that inherits
#   from the Spinnaker class, ImageEventHandler. ImageEventHandler allows the user to
#   define any properties, parameters, and the event handler itself while ImageEvent
#   allows the child class to appropriately interface with Spinnaker.

    moment to notice what parts of the class are mandatory, and what have been
    added for demonstration purposes. First, any class used to define image events
    must inherit from ImageEventHandler. Second, the method signature of OnImageEvent()
    must also be consistent. Everything else - including the constructor,
    destructor, properties, body of OnImageEvent(), and other functions -
