# ImageFormatControl.py shows how to apply custom image settings to
# the camera. It relies on information provided in the Enumeration,
# Acquisition, and NodeMapInfo examples.
#
# This example demonstrates setting minimums to offsets, X and Y, and maximums
# to width and height. It also shows the setting of a new pixel format, which
# is an enumeration type node.
#
# Following this, we suggest familiarizing yourself with the Exposure example
# if you haven't already. Exposure is another example on camera customization
# that is shorter and simpler than many of the others. Once comfortable with
# Exposure and ImageFormatControl, we suggest checking out any of the longer,
# more complicated examples related to camera configuration: ChunkData,
# LookupTable, Sequencer, or Trigger.
