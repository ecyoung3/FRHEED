#   EnumerationEvents.py explores camera arrival and removal events on the interfaces.
#   It relies on information provided in the Enumeration, Acquisition, and NodeMapInfo examples.
#
#   It can also be helpful to familiarize yourself with the NodeMapCallback example,
#   as nodemap callbacks follow the same general procedure as events, but with a few less steps.
#
#   This example creates a user-defined class: SystemEventHandler.
#   This child class allows the user to define properties, parameters, and the event handler itself
#   while the parent classes - DeviceArrivalEventHandler, DeviceRemovalEventHandler, and InterfaceEventHandler -
#   allow the child classes to interface with Spinnaker.

class SystemEventHandler(PySpin.InterfaceEventHandler):
    """
    This class defines the properties and methods for device arrivals and removals
    on the system. Take special note of the signatures of the OnDeviceArrival()
    and OnDeviceRemoval() methods. 
    All three event handler types - DeviceArrivalEventHandler, DeviceRemovalEventHandler, 
    and InterfaceEventHandler - can be registered to interfaces, the system, or both.
    However, in Spinnaker Python, an enumeration event handler must inherit from
    InterfaceEventHandler if we want to handle both arrival and removal events.

    *** NOTES ***
    Registering an interface event handler to the system is basically the same thing
    as registering that event handler to all interfaces, with the added benefit of 
    not having to manage newly arrived or newly removed interfaces. In order to manually
    manage newly arrived or removed interfaces, one would need to implement interface
    arrival/removal event handlers, which are not yet supported in the Spinnaker Python API.
