#   Enumeration.py shows how to enumerate interfaces and cameras.
#  	Knowing this is mandatory for doing anything with the Spinnaker SDK, and is 
#  	therefore the best place to start learning how to use the SDK.
#  
#  	This example introduces the preparation, use, and cleanup of the system
#  	object, interface and camera lists, interfaces, and cameras. It also touches
#  	on retrieving both nodes from nodemaps and information from nodes.
#  
#  	Once comfortable with enumeration, we suggest checking out the Acquisition and/or
#   NodeMapInfo examples. Acquisition demonstrates using a camera to acquire images,
#   and NodeMapInfo demonstrates retrieving information from various node types.
