#   Enumeration_QuickSpin.py shows how to enumerate interfaces
#   and cameras using the QuickSpin API. QuickSpin is a subset of the Spinnaker
#   library that allows for simpler node access and control. This is a great
#   example to start learning about QuickSpin.
#
#  	This example introduces the preparation, use, and cleanup of the system
#  	object, interface and camera lists, interfaces, and cameras. It also
#  	touches on retrieving information from pre-fetched nodes using QuickSpin.
#  	Retrieving node information is the only portion of the example that
#  	differs from Enumeration.
#
#   A much wider range of topics is covered in the full Spinnaker examples than
#   in the QuickSpin ones. There are only enough QuickSpin examples to
#   demonstrate node access and to get started with the API; please see full
#   Spinnaker examples for further or specific knowledge on a topic.

            # available through the camera's TLDevice and TLStream properties.

            # which does not require initialization; please see
            # NodeMapInfo_QuickSpin for additional information on this topic.
